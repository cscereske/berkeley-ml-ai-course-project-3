    "   - K-Nearest Neighbors performed adequately at around 89%\n",

    "   - Support Vector Machine is significantly slower to train compared to other models\n",
    "   - K-Nearest Neighbors and Logistic Regression are the fastest\n",

    "4. **ROC AUC Score**:\n",
    "   - Logistic Regression and SVM have the highest ROC AUC scores around 0.80, indicating good discriminative ability\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Model Performance Comparison**:\n",
    "   - The tuned Support Vector Machine model performed best, achieving the highest F1 score and balancing precision and recall effectively\n",
    "   - Logistic Regression provided comparable results with significantly faster training times\n",
    "   - All models substantially outperformed the naive baseline (predicting the majority class)\n",

    "2. **Key Predictive Factors**:\n",
    "   - Economic indicators (employment variation rate, euribor rate, consumer price/confidence indices) were among the most influential features\n",
    "   - Previous contact outcomes and duration between contacts significantly affected subscription likelihood\n",
    "   - Certain months (particularly March-May and September-October) were associated with higher subscription rates\n",
    "   - Contact method (cellular vs. telephone) impacted subscription likelihood\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Business Recommendations**:\n",
    "   - Target marketing efforts during favorable economic conditions\n",
    "   - Prioritize clients with successful previous interactions\n",
    "   - Consider seasonal timing for campaigns\n",
    "   - Use the contact method associated with higher subscription rates\n",
    "   - Focus on clients with the demographic characteristics identified as important by the model"
